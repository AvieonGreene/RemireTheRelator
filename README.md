# RemireTheRelator


## A website I built for a local realtor to help get in touch with clients.

This  website is a way of helping me solve a local relator solve his problem of getting in touch with cients and making sure his website was limitless on the potential it had,by that i focused on these few points:

 * Making the page responsive
 * Building a form for clients to submit their information into and send to an API the realot has control of
 * Adjusting the page to become veiwable on mobile devices, laptops , etc.
